# 5 Mini Test

To challenge improving myself I completed the five mini test in Python. 

## Questions

1. Code a function called `first_div_16` 
  - ACCEPT two positive integers, n1 and n2, as inputs 
  - RETURN the first number in range(n1,n2) that is divisible by 16. 
  - HOWEVER, if no number in the range is divisible by 16 RETURN 0

2. Code a function called `halve_to_2` 
  - ACCEPT one numeric input. 
  - If the number <= 0, RETURN -1. 
  - If the number > 0, divide that integer over-and-over by 2 until it becomes smaller than 2. 
  - RETURN that smaller-than-2 number, e.g. input of 4 Will yield 1 (4->2->1), 5 yields 1.25 (5->2.5->1.25) etc.
 
3. Code a function called `string_expansion`
  - ACCEPT a non-empty string as input
  - RETURN a string that contains every other character, 2n+2 times, where n is the original index of the letter. e.g. Input of “Hello” should result in "HHlllllloooooooooo". Input of “ROBErt” should result in "RRBBBBBBrrrrrrrrrr".

4. Code a function called `item_count_from_index`.
  - ACCEPT two inputs, a list and an integer-index
  - RETURN a count (number) of how many times the item at that index appears in the list.
  - However, if the integer-index is out of bounds for the list RETURN the empty string (“”) (e.g. list of 3 items, index of 5 is out of bounds)

5. Code a function called `length_times_largest`.
  - ACCEPT a list as input
  - RETURN the length of the list times the largest integer (not float) in the list.
  - However, if the list does not contain an integer, RETURN the empty string (“”).
